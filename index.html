<!--Study planner (Bonus - Optional)
Imagine you have been employed to build a single-page web application that manages a study plan for the Web Development module on the Creative Computing course. Use HTML and CSS to mock-up what this application would look like, without adding any interactivity. You must include:

Wireframe (add image to the directory);
Header, Navigation menu, main content and a footer;
The main content must be split into two or three columns;
Five demo items;
Your HTML should use semantically correct elements;
An external style.css file;
The use of at least one button;
The page does not need to be interactive;
You should focus on the structure and visual layout of the page, but also consider design too;
